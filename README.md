# Tech Stack

The website is built in my favourite Tech Stack and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for building React Components.
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
- [React Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com) for Hero section highlighting.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployments and CI/CD.


# Deployment

Deployment can be done in 3 easy steps.

- Login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or signup for an account if you don't have one.
- Create a `New Project` and select YOUR GitHub repository of the portfolio project.
- Wait for Vercel to deploy your project to production.
